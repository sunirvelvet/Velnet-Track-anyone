# Velnet-Track-anyone : OSINT Program
This is just the side project I am working on nights, and when I am bored.  
Track anyone's location with their phone number, find out their carrier, and more deep data about the target

Goal: Track any phone's real-time location with just a phone number. 

Bigger Goal: Get as much data as possible of the target with a small amount of data [blurred image, social media ID, email, phone number] 
Get Real Time Location, if they are facing North, South, East, or West, and what altitude they are in. 
Access the phone and device connected with it and data within it without notifying the target device.
Turn on/off sensors [Camera, Mic]
Override the target user, and take control of the device.
Show anything on the screen.

What we might have to do: The phone sends [GPS coordinates, nearby wifi data to help with navigation, nearby cellular towers data] we might get super accurate information for the location if we can fuse this.
